## Features

Craftsy was built with a focus on creating a seamless shopping experience. Below you'll find some features that were implemented with that effort in mind.

### User Accounts

Users are able to access the full functionality of this portfolio site without having to register for an account themselves, simply by clicking on the demo login. You can, of course, create an account of your own if you so choose.

Once logged in, users are able to add items to their shopping cart and have them persist until they are ready to checkout, whether that's in the next hour or the next day. No matter, products added to your cart will be there when you log back in.

### Search Bar

If you already have an idea of what you'd like to purchase, go ahead and just type into the search bar. There's no need to browse through all of the categories to find what you're looking for.

### Product Listings

Don't worry if you're just browsing though and not sure yet what you want to pick up! You'll find popular product categories located in the navigation bar, easily accessible from any page. Once you've found the perfect item, adding it to your cart is a breeze. A little orange bubble will pop up next to the cart icon in the navigation bar once you've added your first item to your cart, and it will keep track how many items are in your cart at any time.

Opening up your own shop on Craftsy is also easy. Just navigate over to the shop manager icon in the navigation bar and you'll be able to add new product listings or update existing listings in no time.

### Product Reviews

Any shopping experience would be incomplete without reviews to inform your purchasing decisions. Just scroll to the bottom of any product page to find out what others think before finalizing your order. Add your own review if you like as well!
